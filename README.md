I recently completed an interactive Electric Vehicle dashboard as part of a comprehensive Data Analysis project. This project showcases my proficiency in data analysis, visualization, 
and the use of Tableau. By developing this dashboard, I demonstrated my ability to transform complex data sets into meaningful insights and visually compelling narratives. 
The interactive features of the dashboard allow users to explore various aspects of Electric Vehicle data, highlighting my skills in creating user-friendly and informative analytical tools. 
This project reflects my commitment to leveraging data to drive decision-making and my capability to present data-driven stories in an engaging and accessible manner.



 The dashboard allows users to:

Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.

Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.

Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.

Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.
